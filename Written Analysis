•	In the dataframe comparing charter and district schools, it was evident that charter schools performed better in every category (average math score, average reading score, percent passing math, percent passing reading, percent overall passing). The most notable performance gaps among schools were in the percent passing math, percent passing reading, and percent overall passing. There was a 36 percentage point difference between overall percentage pass rates, with charter schools leading.
•	The dataframe comparing school spending per student indicated a correlation (with a minor exception in the percent passing math column) between higher spending and higher academic success. When taking the extremes in account (the lowest and highest value bins), there was a 32 percentage point difference in overall pass rate, which suggests a relationship between higher educational spending and student success.
